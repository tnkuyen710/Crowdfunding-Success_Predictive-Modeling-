# Predicting the Success of Crowdfunding Projects in Turkey with Supervised Machine Learning

Crowdfunding refers to a fundraising mechanism that enables project owners’ to raise capital by collecting funds or donations from a large number of individuals rather than specialized investors, which is commonly done through online platforms. 

The research in this paper aims to address two fundamental questions: (i) “Is it possible to predict crowdfunding project outcomes before being launched using supervised machine learning algorithms?” and (ii) “What are the most relevant factors that influence project success?”. To answer these questions, the research is structured as follows: Firstly, section 2 presents the existing studies on crowdfunding success factors and machine learning applications. In section 3, the chosen dataset is described and preprocessed using relevant techniques for redundancy and data leakage, data skewness, scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables. This preprocessed dataset is used with the in section 4 described supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forests and XGBoost for binary classification of the crowdfunding projects success. In section 5, the results are evaluated and compared across models to identify the best-performing one. Section 6 and 7 discuss the business implications for stakeholders involved in the crowdfunding ecosystem, as well as giving the outlook on the predictive model.
